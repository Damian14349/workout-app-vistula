# About The Project
WorkoutApp is a comprehensive tool that integrates functionality related to diet, physical activity, and overall well-being, allowing users to take a comprehensive approach to healthy living.

The app allows users to create an account and log in to personalize their workout and diet experience. In the account editing panel, users can enter data such as height, weight, gender, and age, which is key to providing personalized information.
The app offers a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator that assesses weight-to-height ratios, helping users understand their current health situation. In addition, the BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) calculator calculates basal metabolism which is the amount of energy required for the body's basic functions at rest. Based on this, the app also calculates basal caloric requirements and macronutrient ratios (proteins, carbohydrates, fats), allowing users to adjust their diets to meet their goals.

## Implemented functions:

- **Account creation/Login System:** Users can create accounts and log in, allowing them to personalize their training and diet experience.
- **Account edit panel:** Allows users to enter information such as height, weight, gender, and age, which is crucial for personalized data.
- **BMI Calculator:** An assessment of weight-to-height ratio, helping users understand their current health situation.
- **BMI Calculator:** Calculation of basal metabolism, which determines the amount of energy required for basic bodily functions at rest.
- **Basic Caloric Requirements and Macronutrients:** Provides information on basic caloric requirements and macronutrient ratios (proteins, carbohydrates, fats) based on user data.

## Planned expansions
The project plans to introduce two new panels:
- **Panel with recipes:** Will allow users to access healthy recipes according to their caloric needs and dietary preferences.
- **Exercise panel:** Will provide users with the ability to plan and execute a variety of workouts, taking into account their fitness level and goals.
